Q1 
Develop a regression model that links global sales to video game reviews. Explore ways in which
the model fit could be improved through suitable changes to the model specification and variables.
a)	Present the final model and results.
b)	Explain how you developed your model (what was your initial model, what were the key variations you tried and how did you arrive at the final model â€“ and the thought process behind these steps).
c)	Interpret the model results. 

Q2 
For the final model you constructed in question 1, verify whether the various regression
assumptions discussed in the lecture are satisfied. If an assumption is violated, discuss how it can
be handled, and implement the same. Discuss whether this change had a practically significant
impact on your model results.
