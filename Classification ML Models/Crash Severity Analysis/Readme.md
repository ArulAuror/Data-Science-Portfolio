## 1.Background ##

In this project I will predict whether the crash is severe or not. In this project the following steps were excluded:

* Loading the data
* Preprocessing the data
* Explore features or charecteristics to predict crash severity
* Develop prediction models
* Evaluate and refine prediction models using cross validation and hyperparameter tuning
* Final prediction

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Data
The dataset used is the train.csv and test.csv uploaded here. 

### 2.2. Data Preprocessing 

#### Identify and handle missing values ####

#### Correct data format ####

### 2.3. Feature Engineering ###

#### Data Standardization ####


#### Data Normalization ####


#### Binning ####


### 2.3. Data Exploration ###
